class Graph:
    """ Graph representation used in the project

    Instead of adjacency matrix or list, this structure stores information
    about edges as a dictionary, where key is a vertex identifiers and value
    is a hash set containing neighbors' identifiers. Despite the memory waste,
    use of sets and dicts implemented with hash tables highly decreases
    the complexity of some operations on sets (union, intersection, difference,
    membership test), which are extensively used in the algorithms from
    `coloring.py` module.

    Basic operations on a graph are still quite efficient:
    - has_vertex - O(1)
    - empty - O(1)
    - add_vertex - O(1)
    - remove_vertex - O(Î”(G))
    - add_edge - O(1)
    - remove_edge - O(1)
    Except for removing the vertex, all of them have constant time complexity.

    Before an edge is inserted, both vertices must already resist in a graph.
    In case of an inconsistent operation is attempted to be executed, GraphError
    is raised with a proper informative message.
